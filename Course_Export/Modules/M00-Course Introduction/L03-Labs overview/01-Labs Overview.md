# Labs Overview #

This course contains **Labs** at the end of each module. These **Labs** will provide steps and guidelines for completing specific tasks related to the module.

The **Labs** are **not** graded, or verified in any way, and are purely for learning purposes. However, it is strongly recommended that you take the time to attempt each lab task to complete the learning from each module, as items might be covered in the hands-on component that are not easily explained or understood based on the written content.

If you have difficulty completing any lab tasks, you should return to the module content and refer to the demos. The demos broadly cover what is outlined in the Labs at the end of the modules.
