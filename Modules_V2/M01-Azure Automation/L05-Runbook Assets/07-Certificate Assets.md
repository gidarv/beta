# Certificates Assets 


[Certificates assets](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation-certificates/#creating-a-new-certificate)Â can be stored securely in Azure Automation so that they can be accessed by runbooks or DSC configurations by using the **Get-AutomationCertificate** activity. This allows you to create runbooks and DSC configurations that use certificates for authentication or adds them to Azure or third-party resources.
