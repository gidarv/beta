# What Is a Runbook?  

Runbooks deliver the core functionality of Azure Automation by serving as repositories for your custom scripts and workflows. In addition, runbooks typically reference Automation assets, such as credentials, variables, connections, and certificates. They also can contain other runbooks, thereby allowing you to build more complex workflows. You can invoke and run runbooks either on demand or according to your chosen schedule by leveraging Automation Schedule assets.

You can [create your own runbooks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation-creating-importing-runbook/) from scratch or modify runbooks from the [Runbook Gallery](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn781422.aspx), where there is a rich ecosystem of runbooks available, for your own requirements. There is also a vibrant open-source community creating runbooks that you can use to directly apply to your use cases. You can choose from three different [runbook types](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types/) based on your requirements and Windows PowerShell experience. If you prefer to work directly with the PowerShell code, you can use a PowerShell runbook or a PowerShell Workflow runbook that you can editÂ offline or with the textual editor in the Azure portal. If you prefer to edit a runbook without being exposed to the underlying code, you can create a graphical runbook by using the graphical editor in the Azure portal.
