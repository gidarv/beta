# PowerShell Runbooks  

You can use the textual editor in Azure Automation to edit PowerShell runbooks and PowerShell Workflow runbooks. The code editor has intellisense and color coding, with additional special features to assist you in accessing resources common to runbooks.

You can insert code for activities, assets, and child runbooks into a runbook. Rather than typing in the code yourself, you can select from a list of available resources and have the appropriate code inserted into the runbook.

Each runbook in Azure Automation has two versions, **Draft** and **Published**. You edit the Draft version of the runbook and then publish it so that it can be executed. The Published version cannot be edited.
