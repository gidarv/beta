# Automation Account Security  

You can [use role assignments to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/). With Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), you can limit both the scope (resources) and the permissions (roles) that users are given. You will use these roles to control access to Automation resources.
