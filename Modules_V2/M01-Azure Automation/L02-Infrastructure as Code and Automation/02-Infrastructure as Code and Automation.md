# Infrastructure as Code and Automation  

[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](http://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) is a practice that enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of infrastructure, such as networks and virtual machines, to help deliver secure, stable application hosting platforms.

Automation, or the minimization of manual effort, is a core method driving DevOps. It employs scripts and configuration, with the goal of never having to perform the same manual activity twice. DevOps is the optimization of the relationship between developers and information technology (IT) professionals. Automation brings them together by promoting use and familiarity by each with the same processes and tools. The end result is that the job is easier on both sides.

Reproducing environments automatically brings many benefits to the development lifecycle:

*   Automation frees people from performing repetitive, monotonous work. This also helps eliminate mistakes.
*   Automation gives people more time to work on creative ways to provide strategic value to the company.
*   Automated processes are faster than their manual counterparts.
*   Automation improves the quality of the entire release process because it standardizes important steps such as deployments. Ensuring well-understood processes and environments results in predictable outcomes.


Automation reduces costs if you take a medium- or long-term viewpoint. Once they are in place, automated processes cost less than manual processes.
