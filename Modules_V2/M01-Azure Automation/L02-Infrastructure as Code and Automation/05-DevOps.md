DevOps brings together development and operations with efficient tools and methodologies to deliver faster, high-quality applications and services continuously.

### Why implement DevOps?

DevOps not only amplifies the speed with which you can ship working software, but also enables you to develop high-quality, secure, scalable solutions more quickly and with less cost. Customers expect a dynamic, reliable experience when they consume software and services. Teams must rapidly iterate on software updates, measure the impact of the updates, and respond quickly with new development iterations to address issues or provide more value. 

Cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure have removed traditional bottlenecks and helped commoditize infrastructure. Software reins in every business as the key differentiator, and it is an important factor in business outcomes. In today's environment, no organization, developer, or IT worker can or should avoid the DevOps movement.

### How to implement DevOps

Although there is no one right answer for how to do DevOps, there are clear ways that DevOps should not be done. DevOps is not a toolbelt that you can buy from the market. You are doing DevOps wrong if you have only branded one team as DevOps. For an organization to succeed in DevOps, a culture of collaboration and trust must be established and fostered. High-performing DevOps teams adopt several of the following practices:

1.  Agile planning and project management techniques are used to plan and isolate work into sprints, manage team capacity, and help teams quickly adapt to changing business needs. In other words, break the work into sizable chunks that are independent and isolated enough to be delivered in small increments.
2.  Strong source control, usually with Git, enables teams located anywhere in the world to collaborate and integrate code better.
3.  Continuous integration drives the ongoing code merging and testing, which leads to finding defects early.Â Other benefits include less time wasted on fighting merge issues and more rapid feedback for development teams.
4.  Manage technical debt. Teams that cannot identify technical debt end up paying for it by getting trapped in the cycle of fixing defects rather than getting new features released.
5.  Continuous delivery of software solutions to production and testing environments helps organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to ever-changing business requirements.
6.  Production monitoring and application telemetry not only enables a view of the application health in the live site, but also ensures a better understanding of how end users are interacting with your applications.
7.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows infrastructure to be treated like code and to be subject to the best practices that you would apply to code in code reviews and unit testing. IaC enables the automation and validation of network and virtual machine creation and teardown, to help deliver secure, stable application hosting platforms.
8.  Microservices architecture is leveraged to isolate business use cases into small reusable services. This architecture enables scalability and efficiency.
